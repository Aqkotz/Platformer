# Platform Game

*Challenge by Jack Boffa, HHS '14*

This project will give you experience writing graphical applications. You will also learn how to use classes and object-oriented programming to streamline your code.

## What to do

Use Python to create a sandbox platform game. A platform game is a 2D game with a player that jumps between 
platforms (like Super Mario Bros). “Sandbox” simply means that instead of having structured levels, the user 
creates their own environment and plays around in it. In this case, the user will be able to create various 
objects at the mouse pointer by pressing keys on the keyboard. They will also be able to control a player 
object using the arrow keys.

The game will look something like this:
